Introduction
============

Txt2x is a tool for generating HTML and XML documents from plain text
files written using a simple and unobtrusive markup.  It is similar in
function to Markdown [1] or AsciiDoc [2] (actually, it predates these
tools by a few years).

(The HTML generator is currently not available from this repository
because I was not yet able to contact its original co-author to ask for
his permission.  However, a similar HTML generator can be obtained by
modifying the XML generator in the file genxml.pl, which requires only
trivial changes.)


Usage
=====

Since txt2x is a Prolog program, you need a Prolog system to use it.
Txt2x has only been tested on SWI Prolog, but it should run on any
reasonably standard Prolog system.

To generate an HTML file <name>.html from the text file <name>.txt, use
the following commands:

"""
  ?- consult(txt2html).
  ?- txt2html('<name>.txt' '<name>.html').
"""

To generate an XML file <name>.xml from the text file <name>.txt, use the
following commands:

"""
  ?- consult(txt2xml).
  ?- txt2xml('<name>.txt' '<name>.xml').
"""
